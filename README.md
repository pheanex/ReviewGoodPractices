## Don’t focus on style

Style is subjective and does not bring value if it is not consistent. Agree on a style guide and let formatters do the checking.

## Offer examples

Instead of instructing the author what to do, provide example-code. This speeds up the process and avoids misunderstandings.

## Don’t use ‘you’

Word your feedback in a way that minimizes the risk of raising your teammate’s defenses. Be clear that you’re critiquing the code, not the coder. Using ‘you’ increases the risk that they’ll take your criticism personally. Consider using ‘we’ as it stresses the shared code-ownership.

## Frame feedback as requests, not commands

Requests make it easier for the author to push back politely. They may have a good reason for their choice. If you frame your feedback as a command, any pushback from the author comes across as disobedience. If you frame your feedback as a request or a question, the author can simply answer you.

## Tie notes to principles, not opinions

Explain both your suggested change and the reason for the change. Grounding your notes on principles frames the discussion in a constructive way. Provide supporting evidence where possible in the form of links.

## Make the code better, not perfect

Although you might want to explore every opportunity to improve the code, the author’s patience is finite. They might grow frustrated if you withhold approval for too long, because you keep thinking of new ways for them to improve the code. Also don’t too much feedback, as authors may feel overwhelmed if you provide too much feedback at once. Limit your feedback to necessary things and focus on the most important things.

## Respect the scope

In order to keep reviews and changes small, don’t review code that is out of scope of this changelist.
Grant approval as soon as possible

Don’t withhold your approval if there are only minor changes left and trust that the author will consider your feedback and work it in if they agree with it. Don’t be the last cruel gatekeeper who upholds code quality as there will be situations when you can’t be there.

## Be inclusive

Use full sentences to express your suggestions and provide necessary details and context. Doing so allows others to join the discussion easily and better understand your arguments. This allows them to make informed decisions.

## Be specific

Instead of asking open or unbounded changes like “Add more tests”, elaborate on what exactly can be improved or is missing.

## Don't nitpick

Invest author's and reviewers's resources on issues worth solving.
This prevents frustration and allows you to deliver value sooner.
If you feel something is worth changing, don't reduce your feedback by adding something like "nitpick". See [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)
